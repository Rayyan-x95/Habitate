# Habitate — Product Vision (v1.4)

**Habitate** is evolving from a social utility into a **long-term companion app**. It serves as a second brain, a quiet coach, and a trusted archive of your life.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy (v1.4)

### 1. Reflection over Reaction
- We prioritize thoughtful journaling and retrospective insights over instant social validation.
- No "hot takes" or viral mechanics.

### 2. Intelligence over Notifications
- AI is used to surface patterns and insights, not to drive engagement.
- Zero push notifications without explicit consent.
- Insights are cached, offline-first, and dismissible.

### 3. Personal Agency over Algorithms
- Users control what they see and when.
- No algorithmic feeds designed to keep you scrolling.
- "Life Timeline" is a private memory tool, not a public performance.

### 4. Calm UX over Novelty
- Design reduces cognitive load.
- Prioritize whitespace and readability.
- No gamification streaks that induce anxiety.
